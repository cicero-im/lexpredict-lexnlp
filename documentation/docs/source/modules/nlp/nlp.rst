:mod:`lexnlp.nlp`: Natural language processing
==============================================

The :mod:`lexnlp.nlp` module contains methods that assist in natural
language processing (NLP) tasks, especially in the context of developing
unsupervised, semi-supervised, or supervised machine learning.  Methods
range from tokenizing, stemming, and lemmatizing to the creation of
custom sentence segmentation or word embedding models.

This package is structured along ISO two-character language codes. English
components are available under :mod:`lexnlp.nlp.en`.

Extraction methods follow a simple `get_X` pattern as demonstrated below::

    >>> import lexnlp.nlp.en.tokens
    >>> text = "There are ten cows in the 2 acre pasture."
    >>> print(list(lexnlp.nlp.en.tokens.get_nouns(text)))
    ['cows', 'pasture']

The methods in this package are primarily built on the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK),
but some functionality from the Stanford NLP, gensim, and spaCy packages is available
to users depending on their use case.

Tokenization and related methods
--------------------------------

* :ref:`Extracting tokens, stems, lemmas, and parts of speech <nlp_en_tokens>`



Segmentation and related methods for real-world text
----------------------------------------------------

For return-shape, coordinate and failure-behaviour guidance across the legacy
APIs, see :ref:`segmentation_current_api`.  The additive, lossless hierarchy,
strict-budget chunker and embedding-payload contract are described in
:ref:`lossless_segmentation_api`; their evidence, promotion method and future
layout/multi-span extensions are recorded in :ref:`segmentation_v2_design`.

* :ref:`Sentences <nlp_en_segments_sentences>`

* :ref:`Paragraphs <nlp_en_segments_paragraphs>`

* :ref:`Sections <nlp_en_segments_sections>`

* :ref:`Pages <nlp_en_segments_pages>`

* :ref:`Titles <nlp_en_segments_titles>`

* :ref:`Utilities <nlp_en_segments_utils>`

Transforming text into features
-------------------------------

* :ref:`Character Transforms <nlp_en_transforms_characters>`

* :ref:`Token Transforms <nlp_en_transforms_tokens>`, including n-grams and
  skip-grams
