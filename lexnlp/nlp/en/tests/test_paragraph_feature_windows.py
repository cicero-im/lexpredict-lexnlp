"""Characterisation tests for the paragraph feature window.

These pin behaviour that is arithmetically wrong but that the bundled paragraph
segmenter depends on. Read this before "fixing" it.

Both halves of the feature builder clamp the forward window by subtracting the
window size rather than the line position, which is unrelated to how much room
is left in the document:

* ``build_paragraph_break_features`` uses ``len(lines) - line_window_post - 1``.
  For a short document that is too small, so features for lines that do exist
  are dropped. For a line near the end it is too large, and the loop's
  ``except IndexError`` quietly swallows every step past the end.
* ``get_paragraph_break_feature_names`` uses ``lines_count - line_window_post - 1``
  and has no such guard, so once the window reaches the document length the
  value goes negative and the column set loses even its zero-offset entries.

Correcting both to ``min(window, lines_available)`` was tried and reverted. The
bundled segmenter was trained on vectors produced by this arithmetic, so
widening the window at inference time feeds the model features it never saw in
training and it stops splitting on a blank line. ``test_sota_legacy_parity``
catches that: "First operative paragraph." and "Second operative paragraph."
separated by a blank line come back as one paragraph instead of two.

Fixing the arithmetic therefore requires retraining and re-exporting
``paragraph_segmenter.skops`` in the same change. Until then these tests hold
the current behaviour still so the coupling cannot be broken by accident.
